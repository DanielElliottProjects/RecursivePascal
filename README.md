# RecursivePascal

Playing around with Pascal's Triangle, using C(n,k) = C(n-1,k) + C(n-1,k-1) to recursively create rows by working from the base upward.

#Future Improvements
Add ability to go above 25 rows(changing data type)
Add ability to specify a and b(currently based on (x+1)^n, would like to be able to have (a+b)^n, where a and b can be any polynomial.
Fix the right hand side's unsatisfying visuals.
